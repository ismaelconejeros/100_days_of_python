#You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

##e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

#Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

#Hint
#Think about the logic before writing code. How can you compare numbers against each other to see which one is larger?

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

student_scores.sort()
