#Instructions
#You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. 
# You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.

#Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 
#to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.

#Hint
#Look at the function call above to see what the name of the function should be.
#The inputs for the function are positional arguments. The order is very important.
#Feel free to choose your own parameter names.

travel_log = [
{
  "country": "France",
  "visits": 12,
  "cities": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"]
},
{
  "country": "Germany",
  "visits": 5,
  "cities": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
},
]
#ðŸš¨ Do NOT change the code above

#TODO: Write the function that will allow new countries
#to be added to the travel_log. ðŸ‘‡
def add_new_country(country, visits, cities_list):
	new_country_dict = {"country": country, "visits": visits, "cities": cities_list}
	travel_log.append(new_country_dict)

add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
print(travel_log)
