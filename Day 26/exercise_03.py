# List Comprehension 3
# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD

# Instructions
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
# 1
# 1
# 2
# 2
# 3
# 3
# and file2.txt contained:
# 2
# 2
# 3
# 3
# 4
# 4
# result = [2, 3]

# IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# Example Output
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]

# Hint
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.
# First, you will need to read from the files and create a list using the lines in the files.
# This method will be really useful: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_file_readlines.asp
# Remember you can check if a value exists in a list using the in keyword. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_in.asp
# Remember you can convert a string to an int using the int() method. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_int.asp

with open("100_days_of_python\Day 26\exercise_03_file1.txt") as file1:
    file1 = file1.readlines()

with open("100_days_of_python\Day 26\exercise_03_file2.txt") as file2:
    file2 = file2.readlines()

result = [int(i.replace("\n", "")) for i in file1 if i in file2]

# Write your code above ðŸ‘†
