#write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

#To work out the love score between two people:

#Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

#For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
#"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

#For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
#"Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

#Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
#"Your score is **z**."
