#You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. 
#The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

#Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

#Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. 
# For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
