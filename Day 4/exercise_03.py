#You are going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.

#In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

#This map contains a nested list.
#When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
#['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:
#['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

#Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. 
# The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. e.g.:

#First your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.

#Next, you need to use it to update your nested list with an "x".

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇

cord_1 = int(position[0])
cord_2 = int(position[1])

map[cord_1-1][cord_2-1] = "X"

#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
